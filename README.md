# Your Inner Insect
Your Inner Insect was born as a reflection on the theme of metamorphosis through the eyes of Franz Kafka’s book, The Metamorphosis (1916).
It consists of a guided experience where users can explore their social insecurities by answering some questions through different types of interactions. Every answer is associated to a specific insect’s body part. In the end all the answers contribute in giving shape to a new type of insect.

The project was developed during the Creative Coding course at Politecnico di Milano, MA in Communication Design (2021-22).
